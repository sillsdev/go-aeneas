# DTW - Dynamic Time Warping
- RunDTW public function takes in two 2-dimensional float64 arrays (MFCC Results).
- DTW compares the two inputted temporal sequences in order to compute a 1-dimensional sequence of integers.
- The resulting sequence is the difference between the inputted sequence's at each point in time.
